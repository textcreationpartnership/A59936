            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Heb. 4.9.</hi> or the times of refreſhing from the preſence of the Lord, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> explains them, <hi>Acts 3.19.</hi> Therefore to comfort them afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, he hath through the whole Revelation provided words of conſolation to each in the order of their ſufferings, drawn from the New Jeruſalem ſtate in one respect or other, (as from our ſeventh Argument in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel may appear) of all which encouragements his ſaid meek ſufferers ſhall certainly find in their due times the full accompliſhment; for whoſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfactions therein, according to what the Spirit of God hath ſet down, (though myſtically yet ſurely) I have endeavoured to wait upon the Dispencer of all grace in all ſuch wayes of his own, as he hath been pleaſed to lead me to ſuch purpoſe, for divers years paſt, which I believe in much mercy he hath manifested unto me, (however ſome mens apprehenſions thereof may differ) yet in my own ſoul and spirit I am ſufficiently therein ſatisfied, and I hope alſo by his grace, I may at leaſt (if not before publiſhed) yet leave ſuch things behind me, which in due time may alſo, I hope, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie others, when ſuch errours, pervertings, and prejudices are removed as I have already endeavoured to do in my ſecond and fourth part of thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and foundations which I formerly laid down about <hi>1664</hi> unto which I have ſince added divers ſmall Tracts, as examples and patterns to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the uſefulneſs of the former, for the advantage of all ſuch as would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider them; as that on <hi>Gen. 3.15.</hi> ſhewing in what wayes and order (accordingly) the ſeed of the woman, Chriſt Jeſus, hath, and doth, and will [hereafter more eminently] and at laſt totally and finally (when the laſt enemy death ſhall be deſtroyed break the Serpents [Satans] head.

            <p>There is mention of a Trumpet when the Angels ſhall gather the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from the four winds, and two in a Bed, and two in the Field, and two Women in the Mill, the one taken and the other ſhall be left, at the coming of Chriſt in the Clouds, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.30, 31.40, 41. but that laſt deſcending from Heaven will be at the laſt Trump (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

Again, his ſecond coming in the Clouds, will be for Salvation to all the ends of the Earth, in the iſſue of it: but this deſcending from heaven with a ſhout, and the voice of an Arch-Angel, and the Trump of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the laſt Trump will bring utter and final deſolation to all the ends of the Earth; yea then Heaven and Earth ſhall flee away before his face, and no place be found for them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11.

            <p>Furthermore,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the uniting of the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with the other two, is alſo foretold about the beginning of the 1000 years of Chriſts ſaid reign on earth, that then they ſhall become one Kingdome under Chriſt, as is largely ſet down by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the forementioned 37 <hi>chap.</hi> Firſt, by the dry bones, explained ſo by God himſelf, <hi>verſe</hi> 11. <hi>Son of man, theſe bones are the whole houſe of Iſrael;</hi> and after by the two ſticks, one of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the other of <hi>Judah,</hi> from <hi>verſe</hi> 15. to <hi>verſe</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:102112:8"/>20. where again he explains the reſemblance, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. <hi>I will take the children of Iſrael from among the heathen whither they are gone, and will gather them on every ſide</hi> (which was never yet fulfilled) <hi>and bring them into their own Land, and I will make them one Nation in the land upon the Mountains of</hi> Iſrael (not yet fulfilled) <hi>and one King ſhall be King to them all,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and</hi> David <hi>my ſervant ſhall be King over them, and they ſhall have one Shepherd,</hi> v. 22. <hi>and they ſhall dwell in the land which I gave to</hi> Jacob <hi>my Servant, wherein your Fathers have dwelt, and they ſhall dwell therein, even they, and their Children, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Children for ever,</hi> v. 25. <hi>Moreover, I will make a Covenant of Peace with them, and it ſhall be an everlasting Covenant with them, and I will place them and multiply them, and will ſet my Sanctuary in the midſt of them for ever more,</hi> &amp;c. v. 26.</p>
            <p>And how clear and large a Comment upon this and other Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Promiſes to like purpoſe concerning all <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath made. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>Who ſo runneth may read.</hi> God hath not caſt off his People (ſaith he) which he fore-knew, it was true at that time when he ſpake it (as he ſhews <hi>v.</hi> 5.) and will be of the Elect at all times, and though the diminiſhing of the <hi>Jews</hi> was for a time the riches of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to provoke the <hi>Jews</hi> to jealouſie, yet their reſtoring and fulneſs will be a greater riches to them; which he for the ſtrangneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares (as in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion) to a Reſurrection from the dead, <hi>v.</hi> 15. and ſhews they are the natural branches of the bleſſed Fore-Fathers, and ſhall all be graffed in again into their own Olive Tree, and <hi>v.</hi> 26. declares the miſtery of the long continued blindneſs of all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> (as alſo (ſaith he) there is a Vail upon their hearts, but that Vail ſhall be taken away, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and then confirms by Propheſie, their general call, and deliverance, from <hi>Eſ.</hi> 59.20. And ſo ſaith he, <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved</hi> (as it is written) <hi>there ſhall come out of</hi> Zion <hi>the deliverer, and ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from</hi> Jacob; declaring further, <hi>That the ſtrength of the Promiſe conſiſted in the Covenant with their Fore-Fathers, for this</hi> (ſaid God) <hi>is my Covenant unto them (though made of old with their Fore-Fathers) yet reaching ſtill unto them, when I shall take away their ſins.</hi>

            <p>Thus we may ſee in theſe many particulars, what the holy Scripture ſpeaks of them, at, or about the begining of Chriſts Kingdom on Earth, which, though but briefly toucht, yet in this reſpect may ſufficiently demonſtrate to unprejudiced Chriſtians the truth of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But yet more largely it may again appear by what will be done all the ſaid 1000. years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Many other particulars are ſpoken of in Scripture, reſpecting the duties, the dignities, the priviledges and happineſs, both of living (in the Natural life) and the Saints raiſed from the death of the body, wherein they will both be happily exerciſed, and peacefully, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely enjoy the benefits, the ſaid thouſand years of Chriſts reign upon Earth, from his coming in the Clouds of heaven for above a thouſand years ſpace; until his ſitting on that great white Throne, when the Heaven and the Earth ſhall flee away before his face, and no place be found for them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11. <hi>and when theſe viſible Heavens we behold ſhall be no more,</hi> as is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 14.12.</p>
            <p>And ſo we proceed to make up the evidence of this firſt way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, a little to touch upon the third ſort of thoſe things that are declared by the holy Scriptures to be done at the end of the ſaid thouſand years, which are ſo evidently ſet down in the latter part of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> [wherein, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> obſerves, the Holy Ghoſt hath ſet down things more clearly than before] and herein obſerve what he declareth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt concerning Satans looſing again; who after he had told us of his binding, and ſhutting up at the begining of the thouſand years, and for what reaſon; (that he might deceive the Nations no more, till the thouſand years were fulfilled) but then he adds, after that he muſt be looſed for a little ſpace, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. and when he had ſet forth ſummarily the happineſs of the raiſed Saints raign with Chriſt, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divine truths of the different eſtate of the reſt of the dead, which were not to be raiſed till the thouſand years were ended, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5, 6. he proceeds to ſhew in order, how accordingly it ſhall fall out, <hi>v.</hi> 7. as before he had fore-told, that Satan ſhould be looſed then out of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For what is here delivered concerning Satan, and the ſtate of the Saints raiſed, and then of the reſt not raiſed, that are ſaid not to live again till, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is all ſet out with the greateſt diſtinct clearneſs, in each reſpect, that can in ſo ſhort a form or frame of words probably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed or conceived, and as moſt agreeing with the current of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102112:10"/>Scripture concerning thoſe things; which Chriſt was ſo graciouſly pleaſed ſo to make known, for the benefit of his Church in the time of the end, and therefore delivers them ſo clearly and diſtinctly, and ſo leaves them (with all the reſt of this book) unſealed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.10. For from the time of the giving this <hi>Revelation,</hi> and Chriſts receiving his Commiſſion from the Father to open the Seals, and read and execute the particulars in their order, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. he hath been, ſtill is, and will alſo henceforth be in doing, till they all be accompliſhed accordingly, and therefore he ſaith, in reſpect of the order of accompliſhment, <hi>the time is at hand,</hi> chap. 1.3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And Secondly, after the holy Spirit had ſo punctually ſet down the time of Satans looſing out of his Priſon, he proceeds in the next place, to ſhew what ill uſe he would make of his looſing (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him but for a little ſeaſon) at the end of the thouſand years, and though he be fore-told from the word of Chriſt, that his laſt deſperate deviliſh attempt, will be but a vain attempt, againſt the Camp of the Saints and the holy City, and not only bring on effectually the ruine to that world wherein he would ſtill rule, but deſtruction alſo to himſelf with them in the ſaid bottomleſs pit, where the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet (that he had in former times long ſeduced) were caſt above a thouſand years before, yet ſo deſperately wicked (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding) Satan will then be, and (it appears to be the heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon him) that he will then ſo do, <hi>viz.</hi> go out to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Nations, even in ſuch a caſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

By the quality of ſuch Nations which he will deceive and ſeduce (then) into that ſo vain and horrible an attempt, who are deſcribed by the titles of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> even as thoſe great and implacable Enemies to the Church were deſcribed, <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Pope, Ez.</hi> 38, &amp; 39, which by his long ſeducement, were by him brought to their ruine before the thouſand years, when he knew he was to be ſhut up ſo long in his priſon, and when the <hi>Jews</hi> were to be delivered, and placed in their own Land, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. and united with the ten Tribes their Brethren into one Kingdom under Chriſt; and the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſet up, and deſcribed by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> from <hi>chap.</hi> 40. to the end of that Book, there named <hi>[Jehovah Shamma]</hi> the Lord is there: this title or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of ſuch wretched perſons, the holy Spirit is here again pleaſed

The courſe he takes with them, he gathers them together to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, [for it is the moſt natural deſign of the Devil and his moſt wicked agents in all times, to war againſt the Saints] and it was quarrel enough againſt them, both for him and them, that the mannaging well the power of good government, is by God put into their hands, for reſtraining evil and promoting good, (as doubtleſs in that time it will be) when that attempt ſhall be made, for the overthrow whereof that deſign ſhould (probably) ſerve [if it might be] to get ſuch power into their own hands, that Satan by and in them might reign.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſeeming advantage they will think probably they ſhall have, to undertake that helliſh deſign which Satan will provoke and tempt them to make uſe of therein, namely, their very great multitudes and hoſts of evil cumbitants, which are foretold, ſhall be as the ſand of the ſea, <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>

            <p n="10">10. Whereupon follows the eternal execution of Gods wrath upon Satan himſelf, for he is then caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, to be tormented perpetually with the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, ſent thither above 1000 years before, by means of his ſeducement, <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>

            <p>Now as the Jews looking only at Chriſts ſecond glorious coming foretold in the old Teſtament, did uſually-overlook ſuch things as ſet forth the humility of his firſt coming, for both his firſt and ſecond coming [as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> obſerves] are promiſcuouſly ſet down in the old Teſtament, [except in <hi>Daniel</hi>] ſo Chriſtians under the new Teſtament have been apt to overlook the firſt reſurrection, (called in Scripture, the reſurrection of the juſt) under a confuſed notion taken up of the laſt general reſurrection, which once for all (for the myſteries thereof were revealed by degrees) our Saviour hath by his beloved Diſciple <hi>John</hi> ſo fully at laſt declared, by an orderly explication of both in this 20th. Chap. of the <hi>Rev.</hi> for a ſure Key to open (otherwiſe) much myſtical Scripture, concerning the laſt times of the good world, (as part of the 11th. Chap. before to <hi>v.</hi> 15. was a Table for part of this Book, in reference to the order of the bad times of the former evil world) to <hi>chap.</hi> 19. adjoyning to it there the ſtate of the good world to follow it, with the continuance thereof, <hi>chap.</hi> 19, and 20. and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds further in the two laſt Chapters to explain the glorious ſtate and priviledges of it, as he is wont in this Book after things more generally delivered, to give more particular explications of them; ſo here when he had ſpoken of joy at the marriage of the Lamb, <hi>chap.</hi> 19. and that his wiſe had made her ſelf ready, <hi>v.</hi> 7. which he explains, <hi>chap.</hi> 21.9, 10. to be the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> come down from God out of heaven, (which appears to be the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect) which then
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102112:12"/>came with Chriſt at his ſecond coming, as <hi>Zach.</hi> had propheſied of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being by a Metonimy of the ſubject the inhabitants of the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. till they came to take their bodies: wherefore that City prepared, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.10, 16. for the faithfull, is ſaid to have foundations, and ſo is deſcribed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> explains <hi>Zach.</hi> in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14. calling it the coming of Chriſt with all his Saints; and in <hi>chap.</hi> 4.14. yet more clearly [he ſaith] them alſo that ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him, <hi>viz.</hi> to be united to their bodies, at the firſt bleſſed reſurrection, to inhabit the ſaid New <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> on earth that hath foundations, and behold Chriſts glory there, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. And that this firſt reſurrection is from the death of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, hath been cleared by many; but Mr. <hi>Farnworth</hi> in his <hi>Millenium,</hi> hath added lately divers evident reaſons, reſpecting that, and other matters of like nature, <hi>pag.</hi> 49, 50, &amp;c. and proves that it cannot be underſtood of a ſpiritual reſurrection, to which purpoſe were divers hints given in the end of our <hi>Irenicon;</hi> ſee the Appendix.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the grounds of our firſt demonſtration from thoſe Scriptures that concern all the ſaid particulars (to which a great deal more might be added) of which we may ſay, as our Saviour of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> &amp; the Prophets, that ſuch as would not believe them, they would not believe though one roſe from the dead; ſo ſuch as would reject, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade ſo many evidences of Scripture, would not believe, though many more of the like nature were added, ſo hardly are prepoſſeſſed opinions, and prejudices againſt ſome divine Truths of this nature removed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as I confeſs, I experimentally found, till God was pleaſed by many providences and helps afforded, together with remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able guidance of his word and ſpirit, to teach me otherwiſe; as he muſt doe in ſome things, before men will rightly learn them, though by the ſtrength of Arguments conviction may be wrought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from all the particulats before, in, and after the ſaid thouſand years of Chriſts reign with his Saints, the Argument may thus be framed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All ſuch particulars which the holy Scriptures declare, ſhall be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, in and after the ſaid thouſand years, ſhall certainly be fulfilled,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the holy Scriptures declare moſt, or all the ſaid particulars, before, in, or after the ſaid thouſand years to be accompliſhed on earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore then they moſt certainly ſhall be fulfilled on earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Major Propoſition is undeniable to Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The Minor is abundantly proved from many, or all the particulars before ſpecified under the three heads.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2d. <hi>Arg.</hi>
               </note> I proceed to the ſecond Argument drawn from ſundry Texts of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102112:12"/>Old Teſtament, ſpeaking of what concerns that time of Chriſts Kingly Office in the thouſand years which are ſo explained by the ſpirit of God in the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the begining of Chriſts Kingdom of power on earth, (when the Stone becomes a Mountain, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.35. Anſwerable whereunto in Chriſts Kingdom of the Stone he is ſet forth by a Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. that was ſlain, that had ſeven horns, and ſeven eyes, denoting his perfect power and wiſdom in that ſtate: but at the end of it, he comes with his heavenly Hoſts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and conquers the Beaſt and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and caſts them into the Lake, <hi>chap.</hi> 20. binds Satan and ſhuts him up in priſon for a thouſand years, and reigns with his Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the ſame time) but beſides that, for the begining of that his Kingdom, we have that divine Oracle in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. <hi>Sit thou on my right hand, till, I make thy foes thy footſtoole,</hi> which is often ſpoken of in the New Teſtament, not only to ſhew him to be the Son of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.44. though of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> according to the fleſh, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30. yet from the time of his aſcenſion into heaven. When he is ſaid ſo to begin to ſit on Gods right hand, <hi>v.</hi> 34, 35. he [ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> v. 36] was made both Lord and Chriſt; and as that Nobleman in the Parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. went into a far Countrey, and to return when he had received his Kingdome, which was the particular occaſion of that Parable, <hi>v.</hi> 11. [becauſe they thought the Kingdome of God ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately appear] he teacheth, that he muſt return firſt from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right hand; and this he maketh more evident, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21: when he had ſpoken of the ſigns of the laſt times, he tells them of his coming in a cloud with power, <hi>v.</hi> 27. and <hi>v.</hi> 31. thereby ſhews them the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand, namely that Kingdome he ſaid he went to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and then returning ſhould poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for his foes to be made his foot-ſtool, when he comes from the right hand of the Father, we have in the viſion of <hi>Daniel, c.</hi> 7. firſt how a judgment is appointed to deſtroy the beaſt, the wicked horn that ſpoke the great words, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. and the body of the ſaid Beaſt was given to the burning flame. [ſo of <hi>Magog, Ezaek,</hi> 38.6.] at the ſame time he hath the viſion of one like the ſon of man coming in the Clouds of Heaven, to receive the Kingdoms of the world, <hi>v.</hi> 13.14. &amp; 27. of ſuch his coming St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1, 7.8, 9, 10. when he ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance, &amp;c. And in the next <hi>chap.</hi> particularly ſpeaks of the Deſtruction of that wicked one, <hi>v.</hi> 8. whom he will deſtroy with the appearance of his coming: the times alſo reaching to that, are alſo ſet down in order, in the book of the <hi>Rev.</hi> to <hi>chap.</hi> 19.11. where is the Viſion of the execution of the ſame judgement.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:102112:13"/>
            <p> Again, for another great Foe [<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Turk</hi>] then to be ſubdued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is it large ſet forth by the forementioned prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>. Chriſts appearance is revealed to <hi>Daniel,</hi> with his peoples deliverance like a Reſurrection from the dead, <hi>v.</hi> 2.3. which Redemption, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. is joyned with his coming in a cloud with power and great glory, when, ſaith he to the Jews, of whom he had alſo ſpoken before: when ye ſee theſe things come to paſs look up, and lift up your heads, for then your Redemption draws nigh, <hi>v.</hi> 28. and again <hi>v.</hi> 31. then know that the Kingdom of God is nigh at hand; namely, that of the faid 1000 years; to this purpoſe ſpeaks the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.13. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had offered one ſacrifice for our ſins for ever, he ſate down at the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot-ſtool: The end likewiſe of which his expectation ſhall be, (ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> at his glorious appearance, which in his times he ſhall ſhew, who is the bleſſed and only Potentate the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15, which title at his coming, is ſaid to be written upon his veſture, and upon his thigh, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.6. and Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> conceives by the reaping of the Harveſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. may be meant the deſtruction of the Turkiſh power.</p>
            <p>For the confirmation of this argument, to manifeſt that what is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of things reſpecting the Kingdom of Chriſt, ſo explained in the New Teſtament, which to ſuch purpoſe are foretold in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and may hither be reduced; are many of thoſe Scriptures ſpoken of under the two firſt heads of thoſe particulars applyed to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer argument, beſides many others, I ſhall here only point them out as it were: firſt, what was ſaid of <hi>Elias, Mal.</hi> 4.5. is explained, ſoe by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.11. long after <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> death, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (ſaid he) <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall come, &amp;c. ſee pag. 2.</p>

            <p>Again, for the ſetting up Chriſts Kingdom, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13.14. with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102112:13"/>the explication in the latter part of that chapter, applyed ſo, upon the ſame ruine of the beaſt, at the ſame time (as our parallel manifeſts) <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. ſee p. 7.8.</p>

            <p>Many other Scriptures ſo applyed and explained in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be obſerved in what hath been already ſaid in reference to the ſecond head in the thouſand years, and others we ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion afterwards to conſider which will be obvious to be applyed to this purpoſe, we ſhall here at preſent, adde no more: But from hence ſet down the 2d Argument (which will likewiſe ſtrongly back the former) which, from what hath been ſaid may be laid down as follows.</p>
            <p>That ſence and meaning of the ſaid particulars, in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the Spirit of God gives of them in the New Teſtament, or of many of them: is the beſt and trueſt explication.</p>
            <p>But the holy Scriptures in the New Teſtament explain many or the moſt of them in the ſenſe aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Therefore that ſence is the trueſt and beſt explication of them.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:102112:14"/>
            <p> The Major propoſition here is alſo undeniable.</p>
            <p>The minor is ſufficiently evident by what hath been ſet down of particulars before, and more may be: as alſo many arguments may be drawn from all the enſuing foundations, Proceed we then to the</p>
            <p>Third argument, taken from that general reference of St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3.21. [applyed alſo by Chriſt to thoſe times, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. when the ſeventh Trumpet began to ſound] which times (ſaith he) God hath ſpoken of by the mouth of all his holy Prophets, ſince the world began.</p>
            <p>The confirmation of this argument is ſomewhat largely ſet down already (thovgh much more might be added (if it were needful) from the teſtimonies of the ſeveral Prophets in the Old Teſtament, and from the <hi>Pſalms</hi> (as may be ſeen in our Irenicon from pag. 56. to pag. 89.) ſome of which are alſo here named under the former heads whereunto I wholly referr the Reader in this particular, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And ſo we come to the fourth,
<note place="margin">4th. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> drawn from ſuch portions of Scripture as the holy ſpirit hath ſet ſome marks upon, which may diſcover unto us, that they ſpeak ſomewhat that belongs to thoſe laſt-times.</p>

            <p>So in <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.26.

            <p>In like manner in <hi>Baalams</hi> Propheſie, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.24. Where the Ships of Chiittim are ſpoken of, which are again applyed by <hi>Daniel,</hi> to the beginning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, when by the <hi>Roman</hi> Navies appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> neer <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he was laſt vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.30.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102112:14"/>be the laſt, that ſhould afflict <hi>Eber</hi> or <hi>Ebrewes,</hi> and accordingly the laſt head of that Empire then is deſcribed by the feet and toes of the great image, ſetting forth thoſe 4 Mettle-Kingdoms, upon the finiſhing of which Dominion of the Gentiles over the Jews (called by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour the fulfilling of the times of the Gentiles, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. when the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage &amp; long captivity of the <hi>Jews</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſraelites</hi> is to end, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> in thoſe threatnings ſet in order, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. ſeems prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically to include the order of Gods proceedings towards that people, and therefore when he comes to ſpeak of their deiiverance from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, he ſpeaks of Prayer and Humiliation to be uſed as was then accordingly (remarkably) done by <hi>Daniel,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by books, <hi>c.</hi> 9.2. from <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.12. and 29.10. that God would accompliſh 70 years in the deſolations of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had propheſied of ſuch praying, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.12, 13. Then ye ſhall call upon me, and ye ſhall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, &amp;c. but ufterwards he promiſeth a free deliverance only from himſelf from their laſt captivity, for his Covenant with the fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that people, who are beloved for their fathers ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> there ſpeaketh.</p>

            <p>So <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.28. it is uſed to ſhew that the viſion of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image contained ſomething that reached to thoſe laſt days, and the like uſed <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.14. in his laſt large viſion to the end, when that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon was ſeen of <hi>Daniel</hi> [probably of Chriſt, repreſented as to St. <hi>Iohn Rev.</hi> 1.] he then told <hi>Daniel</hi> he was then come to tell him what ſhould befall his people in the latter days, for (ſaith he) yet the Viſion is for many days.</p>

            <p>Alſo Mr. <hi>Huit</hi> upon <hi>Daniels</hi> propheſie all along expounds the 4th. Monarchy in <hi>Daniel</hi> to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy.

Alſo <hi>Carion</hi> in his Chronicle enlarged and expounded by <hi>Phil.

And as for that too much (formerly) received opinion of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> and <hi>Laegidae,</hi> their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fourth Monarchy, which hath been a great obſtruction to many learned men, from diſcerning the right time and order, yea conſequently the very ſence &amp; intention of the Book of <hi>Revelation</hi> (as might be made evident) in good part, and which opinion amongſt many learned men of later times, who have been well verſed in thoſe ſtudies, is altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, as being inconfiſtent with Scripture, Hiſtory, and Experience; yea it would cut off the comfortable evidence of the great promiſe of ſetting up Chriſts ſpiritual kingdome in its due time, namely, in the dayes of [one] of thoſe Kings, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> expounds that Text, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.44. and gives an example for it in <hi>Judg.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Jeptha</hi> was buried in the Cities of <hi>Gilead,</hi> ſo ſay the Tranſlators in [one] of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Gilead;</hi> and had not the <hi>Roman</hi> been one of the ſaid Kings, how had that prophefie been true? But the holy Scriptare (as was ſhewed) reckons the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy from their fraying away <hi>Antiochus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanes,</hi> Dan. 11.30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe learned Hiſtorians and Chroniclers, with others of great worth, in many reſpects agree therein, and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly avouch it ſo to be, and in many things evident experience in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments of theſe latter times, as reſpecting the fourth Monarchy, which were prophetically fore-ſhewed, doth prove the ſame, or in the times of the end, which is the ſame, as that of the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> Dan. 11.40, 41. the two firſt woe trumpets, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9, &amp;c. with many like matters too evident to be reaſonably withſtood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore by judicious and unprejudiced perſons, greater evidence (I conceive of this nature) will not be expected, than the unbyaſſed judgement of ſo many able perſons, verſed in thoſe ſtudies, who give their reaſons for their judgement, and find them made good by experimental accompliſhments, the utmoſt determination of all ſuch hiſtorical diſſents.</p>
            <p>Come we then to the ſixth Argument,
<note place="margin">6th. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> which is from that part of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102112:16"/>
               <hi>Daniels</hi> Viſions that concern the Roman Monarchy ſince Chriſts firſt coming in the fleſh (together with the ſtate of the true Church thence all along under it, which is in great part the ſubject of the book of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, from <hi>chap.</hi> 3. to 20. <hi>chap.</hi> as ſome of the ſaid learned perſons and others have likewiſe cleared, and as alſo may be ſeen by our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement and parallel, on <hi>Daniel,</hi> and of our fummarie thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other obſervations to confirm the ſame as follow, &amp;c. Even as the laſt part of the Rev. concerns Chriſts ſecond coming, and the ſtate of things in this world, afterward <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20, 21, 22. And as the forenamed learned and judicious perſons, have owned the Roman Monarchy, to be that fourth that was foretold by <hi>Daniel</hi> in ſundry Viſions: ſo have ſome of them declared upon ſolid grounds, that divers of <hi>Daniels</hi> Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reach to the time of Chriſts ſecond coming, and ſet down ſome generals of the ſtate of things afterwards, which alſo may to unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced perſons be made evident by a brief and general view of the ſubſtance of the things conſidered in that book, eſpecially as reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting things after <hi>Daniels</hi> time.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there are two general Decypherings of all time to come, as two witneſſings of the ſame truth: one made to a <hi>Gentile. Dan.</hi> 2. <hi>viz. Nebuceadnezzar</hi> in the great Image ſetting forth the 4 Mettle-Kingdoms, ſucceeding each other (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> obſerves) namely, by the Gold the <hi>Caldean,</hi> by the Silver the <hi>Mede</hi> or <hi>Perſian,</hi> by the Braſs the <hi>Grecian,</hi> by the Iron the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchies; which were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue whilſt the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had the Dominion: called by our Saviour the times of the <hi>Gentiles, Luke</hi> 21.24.</p>
            <p>Another made to a Jew, <hi>viz.</hi> the greatly beloved Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> c. 7. by a Viſion of four Beaſts, ſetting before him again [with Chriſts Kingdom to ſucceed the laſt] the times, order, and qualities of the ſaid four King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and with many things of Chriſts, from Antichriſts deſtruction, that was not expreſſed in the former Viſion, or explication of the four mettals, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. which Kingdomes by both Viſions were to continue du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the long bondage of <hi>Daniels</hi> own people, till the wicked horn or beaſts body be given to the burning flame, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11. &amp; Chriſt come in the clouds, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. And concerning this large extent of the times of both theſe general Viſions, <hi>Daniel</hi> is taught by the Spirit of God to ſet his ſtamp and impreſſion upon it, clearly to that purpoſe, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.28. God (ſaith he) makes known to the King what ſhall be in the latter dayes, <hi>Heb.</hi> poſtremity of dayes, (as likewiſe doth the Angel again, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.14.) And accordingly <hi>Daniel</hi> expounds, when the ſtone cut out of the mountain without hands, (that appears to be Chriſts ſpiritual kingdom from his Aſcenſion to his coming again in perſon) whilſt he is break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Divinely the lower parts of the great Image, and eſpecially the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102112:16"/>feet and toes of the ſaid Image to powder, like the duſt of the ſummer threſhing, &amp;c. and then the ſaid Kingdome of the Stone will become a great mountain filling the whole earth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 35.</p>
            <p>And for the other Viſion <hi>c.</hi> 7. of the 4 Beaſts ſhewed to himſelf, he is directly guided by the Spirit of God to ſet down how the beaſt ſhould be deſtroyed as was ſaid when the time of his date was out: <hi>viz.</hi> his time, times, and the dividing of a time (or 1260 days of years, as in the <hi>Rev.</hi> is explained) That then he had the Viſion of Chriſts coming perſonally, in the clouds of Heaven (which is his ſecond coming) ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: and Gods giving all the Kingdoms of the world to him, that all Nations under the whole heaven ſhould obey him v. 27. perſonally, during that his <hi>Davidical</hi> Kingdom in the 1000 years. And as the deſcription of the Iron Kingdom doth fitly belong to the Romane, whoſe ſtrength and prevailence hath been ſuitable thereunto, ſo do all well approved expoſitors underſtand it, and as it was in two thighs or legs ſince <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in the Eaſt and Weſt Empires: ſo the feet and toes (in the time of the Pope and ten Kings) have been as part of Iron and part of Clay, under this laſt ſaid head of Government, the Popedom, both in its Eccleſiaſtick and Politick capacity, which as Iron and Clay cannot be mingled: and though the ſaid ten Kings have ſought to mingle themſelves with the ſeed of men (that is, have endeavoured by marriages to ſtrengthen themſelves) yet they have not cleaved one to another: <hi>Daniel</hi> foretells it ſhall be in vain, which is ſo notorious. That it is ſaid to be the obſervation of the Grand Signior (the <hi>Turk</hi>) that they will never agree till his fingers are all of a length: which ſo animates him againſt the Emperour and Pope to aſſault them. The other deſcription of the fourth beaſt <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the ſaid <hi>Romane</hi> Kingdom ſet forth to be ſo terrible, monſtrous, and cruel with the ten horns that aroſe on the beaſt, and another little horn, among them, or behind them, that ſpake ſuch great words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the moſt high, are orderly deſcribed, and ſuitably expounded, in the book of <hi>Rev.</hi> as may be obſerved in our abridgment and parallel, and ſummary of <hi>Daniels</hi> viſions, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And divers things are again obſervable in ſome of the viſions that concern the order and times of the ſaid Kingdoms and Beaſts further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, as <hi>c.</hi> 9. after the end of the 70 weeks when Chriſt had put an end to Typical ſacrifice; by his death in <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his Raign, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks of the Prince, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> people that ſhould come to deſtroy the City and Sanctuary, <hi>v.</hi> 26. which was fulfilled by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Veſpatian:</hi> and in the two laſt verſes he ſets forth the very long deſolation that ſhould follow upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and her people in thoſe general expreſſions: until the conſummation, and that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102112:17"/>determined ſhould be powred out upon the deſolate: which is alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by our Saviour, till the times of the Gentiles Dominion [in the four Kingdoms and Beaſts] be fulfilled, <hi>Luk</hi> 21, 24.</p>

            <p>Alſo in the laſt large prophetical viſion of the general ſtate of that people, &amp;c. there are many things referr unto the Roman Monarchy: firſt, in that the Angel tells him, <hi>c.</hi> 10.14. that he came to make him underſtand what ſhould befall his people in the latter, or poſtremity of days: and in <hi>c.</hi> 11. he ſets before him the degrees of the riſe of the Roman Kingdom.

            <p>The ſeventh Argument is taken from the promiſes and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made and given to the overcomers and ſufferers in all times fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, both in the <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. <hi>chap</hi> and alſo all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long afterwards referring to the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate, till the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy be utterly deſtroyed and ruined, and then thoſe promiſes and encouragements take place and are fulfilled, as appears from <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. to the end of that book; which ſtate the ſpirit of God three times at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſteth, and ſtrongly confirmeth, <hi>c.</hi> 19.9. &amp; 21.5.22.6. as foreſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the backwardneſs of men to believe it, for, ſaith our Saviour, when the Son of man comes, ſhall he find faith upon earth. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>To inſtance in ſome of the promiſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. <hi>c.</hi> as firſt that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>c.</hi> 2.7. to eat of the tree of life, there recorded, is to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. So <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. to him
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102112:17"/>that overcometh will I grant to ſit with me in my throne, &amp;c. is to be performed in the time of Chriſts viſible Kingdom on earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. when the Saints ſhall live again bodily, &amp; reign with Chriſt a 1000 years.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, <hi>c.</hi> 3.12. promiſe is made to be a Pillar in the houſe of God, and to go no more out, and to have the name of God written on them: ſo alſo anſwerably <hi>c.</hi> 22.3, 4. his ſervants ſhall ſerve him, they will make it their buſineſs, and it will be their happineſs ſo to doe, and they ſhall ſee his face, and his name ſhall be in their foreheads. See more in the Appendix after the Irenicon, p. 106, 107.</p>
            <p>In like manner, for after-times of ſuffering the repreſentative 4 li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wights, and the 24 Elders in their new Song of praiſe to the Lamb for their Redemption: not only that they were made ſpiritual Kings and Prieſts unto their God: but in a way of great exultation add that general conſolation for all ſufferers afterwards, who ſhould have alſo the ſame intereſt therein with them: And (ſay they) we ſhall reign upon earth: and this alſo was to be accompliſhed in the time of Chriſts Kingdome (as before ſaid) from <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4. and there is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added, <hi>v.</hi> 6. they were made Prieſts unto God and Chriſt, and reigned with him a 1000. years and that all theſe will be upon earth. See the 15 evident reaſons manifeſting that the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be upon earth, in a ſmall tract, on <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.17.</p>
            <p>And for more particular encouragements, ſomewhat is ſet down for following ſufferers, that hath particular relation to the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate, and not improbably, that forementioned, had ſpecial reference to the primitive ſufferers by the greatred Dragon, under ſome of the ſeals, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Alſo thoſe ſealed ſufferers <hi>c.</hi> 7. which ſeem <hi>c.</hi> 9.4. to be referred to the times of the 5t and 6t trumpet under the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny decypherings of the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate, ſet before them, as to be clothed in white, to have Palms in their hands, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and to ſing praiſe to the Lamb, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and again the Lamb ſhall feed them and lead them to the fountains of living waters, and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, <hi>v.</hi> 17. which with many other like, are again repeated in the order of accompliſhment in the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate, when it ſhall come <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. &amp; 20. &amp; 21, 22. as may be ſeen in many particulars.</p>
            <p>And ſo alſo for the ſufferers in ſeveral times under Anti-chriſt, as firſt for the witneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. when their time is finiſhed, Chriſts Kingdome of power upon earth will begin, <hi>v.</hi> 7. &amp; many excellent things are ſet before them, in that ſtate of things to the end of the chapter.</p>
            <p>Alſo for all ſufferers under Anti-Chriſt, <hi>c</hi> 14. is ſet before them the Viſion of the 144000. of the Lambs-followers for an encouragement,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102112:18"/>them and us watch and pray always that we may be accounted worthy to eſcape all thoſe things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe and other improvements we only here touch upon, having ſpoken already elſe where to theſe, and the like purpoſes.</p>
            <p>As to the miſapprehenſions of ſome not well verſt in theſe ſtudies, I ſay (at preſent) that I am ſo far from diſowning them, that I reckon Gods manifeſting to me thoſe Divine (though myſtically ſet down) Scripture Truths therein contained, to be amongſt gods greaceſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to me in this life, and an excellent part of the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as not only that great myſtery ſearcher, learned and judicious Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> judged of them, but what by his means Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> and other eminent perſons in his time, were greatly affected with: But as for the antient errours by ſome unjuſtly affixed thereon, I utterly reject them, and alſo our <hi>Fift Monarchy</hi> mens (ſo called) ſcandalous, both errours and practiſes (being not well inſtucted in theſe Truths) I not only abhorre, as Unchriſtian, and confute, as Antiſcriptural in general, but alſo as againſt relative Obligations by divine Law; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly inconſiſtent with theſe Divine Truths, of Chriſts eminent deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the man of Sin at his glorious appearance, when he will ſet up his Kingdom, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. Which neither can be done by men, nor will be accompliſhed, till his ſet time for it ſhall come (as <hi>page</hi> 15. of the firſt part, the preface of the 2<abbr>
